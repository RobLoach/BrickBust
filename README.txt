DESCRIPTION
	A simple recreation of the classic BreakOut game using Microsoft
	XNA Technology.  The goal of the project was to increase
	knowledge of the design behind XNA as well as implement an
	expandable game level system.


FEATURES
	- Takes advantage of Microsoft XNA Technology
	- Play up to 10 completely different levels
	- Different coloured bricks indicating brick health
	- Easy to read code
	- A BitmapFont GameComponent to render text on the screen


GAMEPLAY
	Clear all the bricks from the screen by bouncing the ball
	off of your paddle.  Move your paddle with the arrow keys.
	To push the ball in a different direction, move your paddle
	in the direction you want the ball to go when it hits.
	

IMPROVEMENTS
	There are many ways on how one could improve upon BrickBust:
	- You could implement a main menu using the BitmapFont
	  GameComponent to render the menu items
	- Creating a highscore list would let other users challenge
	  one another
	- Make up to 25 different levels using the textual level
	  loading system
	- A Game Over screen would be nice
	- Powerups would add a huge amount of replay value
	- Having the ball bounce off at a vector direction in
	  accordance with the paddle would give more control
	  to the player.
